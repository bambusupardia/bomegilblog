His breakout single<strong>, “The Race,” from 2017 went to #44 on the US Billboard Hot 100</strong> and was certified platinum by the RIAA in January 2018. After a countrywide manhunt, he was finally captured in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and the song about his arrest went viral.</p><p>After three months on the lam, on <strong>June 30, 2017</strong>—the same day “The Race” was released—McIntyre was finally apprehended by <strong>U.S. marshals.</strong> The track eventually earned a platinum certification. McIntyre’s return to Texas for his crimes prompted some of his supporters to publicly express their approval of him on social media.&nbsp; Santana World, Tay-debut K’s mixtape, was released by his management company on July 29, 2017, while he was still in the custody of the Tarrant County Jail in Fort Worth, Texas. The project was met with praise from both reviewers and fans alike.</p><h2 id=is-tay-k-facing-any-jail-time-how-soon-will-he-be-released-from-prison>Is Tay-K facing any jail time? How soon will he be released from prison?</h2><p><strong>Although his trial has not yet begun,</strong> his co-defendants have all been sentenced and given terms of imprisonment ranging from <strong>20 years to life.</strong> Of these, roughly half were minors at the time of the robbery.</p><p><strong>Tay-K was a minor</strong> at the time of the crime, hence his maximum sentence is life in prison without parole, despite reports and statements to the contrary from media outlets and <strong>fellow rappers like T.I.</strong></p><h2 id=exactly-where-is-tay-k-right-now>Exactly where is Tay-K right now?</h2><p><strong>Tay-K is currently in Tarrant County</strong> for his weeklong capital murder trial. In the event that he is not found guilty of capital murder, he and his three attorneys are requesting that the jury consider placing him on probation for his role in the 2016 incident.</p><p>The rapper is also facing charges in another capital murder case, this one from <strong>Bexar County,</strong> and a second aggravated robbery case, from Tarrant County. Tay-K was under home arrest for this case when he ripped off his ankle monitor and fled.</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;Where is Jon Batiste Now?

While inside, he has been accused of trying to form a prison gang and has had his cell phone confiscated for being in violation of facility policy.</p><h2 id=is-tay-k-suicidal-not-according-to-his-managers-update>Is Tay-K suicidal? Not according to his manager’s update.</h2><p>An Instagram photo of <strong>Tay-K wearing a jail anti-suicide smock</strong> went viral in February of this year. Those who support Tay-K were understandably worried that Tay-K had made an attempt on his life or threatened to do so.</p><p>In any case, his manager went public with an update on the rapper’s mental condition to reassure his followers. In a nutshell, he said that the picture was “<strong>almost 7 months old</strong>” and that “Tay is not suicidal.” The message went on to say, “He did that to get out of the solitary confinement he’s been in for close to two years.” The lengths to which one must go in order to be treated humanely in a messed-up scenario are, to put it mildly<strong>, “crazy</strong>.”</p><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6K8s7rEZp%2Baqp2osm6%2FwKasq5mZYriquMueqWavkah6s7HLnpisnZRivK95z5qpqKSVYsSpsdGeZKKrXZ2ybrrOsGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-are-falah-al-jaizani-and-tracey-stafford-meet-maddison-jaizani-parents.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Are Falah Al-Jaizani And Tracey Stafford?
