The family members were nobles with close ties to the throne and reported directly to the French king himself.</p><p>The Château, which was colloquially called Motte Bauçay or Baussay, weathered centuries of political turmoil. It was taken over twice by the English during the Middle Ages and later pillaged during the French Revolution.</p><p>Finally, in 1809, the dilapidated castle was bought by François Hennecart, a wealthy French businessman who restored the building to its former glory and developed a splendid vineyard on its grounds. The Château de la Mothe-Chandeniers was passed on to Hennecart’s descendants until it was inherited by Baron Edgard Lejeune.</p><i class="fa fa-times"></i> <span class=caption-body>Château de la Mothe-Chandeniers was originally owned by the Bauçay family who had close ties to the French king.</span><span class=credit>Guillaume Souvant/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>The Château became famous under the ownership of Baron Edgard Lejeune, who lived and threw lavish parties there. </span><span class=credit>Guillaume Souvant/AFP via Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>One of the most distinct features of Château de la Mothe-Chandeniers is the giant moat that encircles it.</span><span class=credit>cmchandeniers/Instagram</span> <span class=caption-body>The estate stretches across 2.5 acres of land and is about 800 years old.</span><span class=credit>cmchandeniers/Instagram</span> <span class=credit>cmchandeniers/Instagram</span> <span class=caption-body>In 1932, the estate was ravaged by a fire, which cost several million francs in damages.</span><span class=credit>cmchandeniers/Instagram</span> <span class=credit>cmchandeniers/Instagram</span> <span class=caption-body>The old Château had endured so much devastation that it became too expensive to maintain.
