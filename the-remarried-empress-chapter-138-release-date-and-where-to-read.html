Rashta loses her luster the moment she catches sight of it. She was curious as to the circumstances behind the infant’s arrival. Since the infant has never been held by its mother since birth, the visitors have asked the empress to give the infant a hug and bless it.</p><p>Rashta is aware that if she declines, it will make people uncomfortable. She remembered it being quite rigid and frigid when she held it in the past. However, suddenly it seemed quite active and alive. After snapping out of her stupor, she prays over the infant and hands it back. Despite her dark nature, Rashta was a devoted mother. The visitors pay their respects to the Emperor and Empress and then depart.</p><p>Read More- Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu Chapter 123 Raw Scans, Spoilers, and Summary</p><h2 id=h-interview><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 medrectangle-4 medrectangle-4637 adtester-container adtester-container-637" data-ez-name=sportslumo_com-medrectangle-4><span id=div-gpt-ad-sportslumo_com-medrectangle-4-0 ezaw=336 ezah=280 class=ezoic-ad></span></span>Interview</h2><p>The commoner reporter was the one who met Rashta through Duke Ergi and conducted the interview. Rashta’s optimistic outlook on the future of the Eastern Empire and its people made for a remarkable article. Rashta was relieved that he said nothing, but then he suddenly started talking. More than a month had passed since his sister was last seen.</p><p>She had a job in the palace, so he followed her there. Even supposedly resigned from her job and disappeared with someone, but he knew this to be untrue. She had no motive to keep her romantic life a secret from him because of how well they got along.
