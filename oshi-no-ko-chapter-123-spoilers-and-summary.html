Yes, the spoilers for the upcoming chapter have been leaked and it seems Aqua and Ruby are getting more close to each other. The spoilers and summary were posted by @sneakyoshi on Twitter that can be deleted any time soon. Last time the same account provided the spoilers and it was pretty accurate, so we can expect the summary to be true. You can expect the raw panels to publish by 3-4 July 2023. Without wasting any time, let’s dive in straight for the summary of the chapter. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-646 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 id=h-spoilers-and-summary-of-oshi-no-ko-chapter-123><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-869 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=869></span>Spoilers and Summary of Oshi no Ko Chapter 123</h2><p>Oshi no ko chapter 123 starts with Ruby’s grip on Aqua being very firm. Screaming, “Doctor! So you’ve been right here with me the whole time! But why?” What were you thinking? Weakness in Aqua’s Appearance. Aqua says, “I am a fan of yours; I’ve told you this before. You’re the sick kid in the hospital whose eyes are brighter than the sun. It’s as though your eyes reflect your dreams. You shone brighter than Ai back then. As soon as he said that, a bright light shone down on Ruby.”</p><p>“I was beginning to worry that you’d lost track of Mama and B-Komachi. Even tried to get in touch with the hospital, but they said you disappeared. I never imagined that you would die.</p><p>I was afraid that no one could be trusted anymore. In no way will I forget. My entire motivation was to exact vengeance. Ai’s sake or the Movie’s.” While resting his hands on her shoulder, Aqua remarked. Ruby was greatly offended; she said, “I went to great lengths to avenge Mama and Sensei.” I lied a lot and did a lot of awful things. And I felt pain in my chest and a knot in my gut. I felt further and further off the proper road the more I lied.</p><p>Read More- Blue Lock Chapter 223: Release Date, Spoilers, Recap & Where To Read?</p><h2 id=h-ruby-wants-to-marry>Ruby Wants To Marry?</h2><p>Aqua stroked Ruby on the head when she heard Ruby’s comments. You’re you, and Ai is Ai. No need to make things up. You need to follow your own way; there’s no point in pursuing Ai’s delusion. Do your own thing. Ruby then sobbed even more deeply into Aqua’s chest.</p><p>I felt like someone was squeezing my tummy and chest simultaneously. The more I lied, the further I felt I was straying from the correct course. Aqua responds with a soothing pat on Ruby’s head after hearing this.</p><p>I’ve told you this before: you’re the kid I pushed about. The hospital room where the child I helped bring into the world was filled with suffering, but the child’s eyes remained bright as if they could still see their dreams. You shone brighter than the sun that day, and love itself was brilliant.<br>Ruby is the center of attention. A crow girl has been spotted peeking through the window.</p><p>Let’s get it together now, Ruby. This will allow the movie to be shot exactly how you want it. Perhaps this will be the turning point in your career as an idol. However, you should not do this action, as the result of your naivete would be disastrous. You are not someone who should seek vengeance. At this point, I can’t help but feel terrible for you.</p><p>“Onii-chan, I trust you; I was once more brilliant than Mama. I haven’t forgotten that either! When I turn 16, you said you’d marry me, right? Okay, I’ll admit it: I’m 16 now. Ruby blushed. That’s all the summary was and we expect the spoilers to be true for the upcoming chapter.</p><p>Read More- Mashle: Magic and Muscles Chapter 162: Release Date, Recap, and Where to Read?<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-824 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span data-ez-ph-id=824></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnn6i1qnnNqGSkp12YtaK8056pZmliaHq0vM6io56qo2Kur7CMrKympZGnxnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./page-kennedy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Page Kennedy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./disney-world-death-2023-news.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>New Disney World Incident Report Includes a Death Best Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./firefly-lane-timeline-what-years-do-the-show-take-place-in.html>'Firefly Lane' Timeline - What Years Do the Show Take Place In?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./funny-news-2018.html>14 Hilariously Funny News Stories You Missed In 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nazi-rise-to-power.html>36 Chilling Photos That Explain The Nazis' Rise To Power</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-horrifying-facts-regarding-lori-ann-slesinskis-murder.html>5 Horrifying Facts Regarding Lori Ann Slesinskis Murder</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-ahn-2.html>Ali Ahn Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaVibe.
