Within just two years, the U.S. unemployment rate more than doubled, reaching a whopping ten percent in 2009.</p><p>The crisis went worldwide and ultimately became the worst global recession since World War II. But none of it held a candle to the Great Depression.</p><p>During the Great Recession, the worldwide GDP fell by less than one percent. During the Great Depression, that fall was 15 times worse. And in the U.S. in particular, unemployment during the Great Depression increased not by a mere factor of two, but by a factor of six, ultimately hitting historic highs of about 25 percent in 1933.</p><p>The trouble began in earnest four years earlier with the Wall Street crashes of September and October 1929. Fueled by excessive stock speculation and shaky banking standards unequipped to handle those investments, the crash plunged the U.S. and the rest of the Western industrialized world into the worst economic cataclysm in modern history.</p><p>And perhaps no place in America felt the effects of the Great Depression worse than the place where it at least nominally started: New York City.</p><p>For decades before the crash, both European immigrants and domestic rural migrants had been flooding into New York, causing the city's population to double between 1900 and 1930. With so many new people â€” many of them impoverished to begin with â€” pouring in, New York's housing and job prospects were shaky to say the least even before the crash.</p><p>And when the crash came, the results were devastating. In the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">words of the New York Tenement Museum</a>:</p><p>"By 1932, half of New York's manufacturing plants were closed, one in every three New Yorkers was unemployed, and roughly 1.6 million were on some form of relief. The city was unprepared to deal with this crisis."</p><p>Yet the city, under the leadership of Mayor Fiorello Laguardia, ultimately proved well prepared to respond to the crisis. To say nothing of his administration's work relief programs, LaGuardia's housing initiatives shut down 10,000 decrepit tenements (more than half of which lacked central heating and toilets) and forced landlords to upgrade another 30,000.</p><p>In the end, the Great Depression served to expose the relatively hidden wounds that had been festering in New York for years â€” or at least force the powers that be to do something about them. And with those wounds cleaned out, the city was able to rebuild into something stronger and become, in many ways, the New York we know today.</p><p>Next, see <a href=#>how the Great Depression crippled the entire nation</a> and <a href=#>African-Americans in particular</a>.
