However, a Telugu newspaper published the interview, portraying as if Rajamouli had written a letter to Krish, to express his appreciation for the film.

According to Krish-<br><p>Kangana has done 20-25 per cent of the first half and 10-15% in the second half. I didn’t shoot a song and I didn’t shoot her entry scene. In the second half, she has even re-shot some scenes which I had done in a different way. I don’t think how Kangana can sleep well by taking the first credit in direction when she does not deserve it.</p><p>In response to Krish, her sister, Rangoli Chandel, lashed out at him in a series of tweets, in which she told that Kangana had begged him to take the credits for the film but Krish did everything to ruin the film. In reply to rangoli, Krish said- <span class=footnote_referrer_wpusm id=reflocid_5><a href=#>[5]</a></span></p><p>Kangana and I are both not going away from this industry so soon. I will direct many more films in future and so will she. People will know who stands where.
