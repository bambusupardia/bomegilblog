Four other officers, identified as Robert Feriello, Thomas Gurba, Kyle Edmonds, and Dylan Ely, were also present at the fatal incident.</span></p><ul><li><span>According to the Attorney General’s Office, Chin was allegedly holding a 3-foot-long sword when the officers arrived at his home, prompting Feriello to deploy his pepper spray at the man and later Kokinakous to open fire at him. Chin was pronounced dead in Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital at 5:28 p.m.</span></li><li><span>The Attorney General’s Office did not release any further details as the investigation is ongoing. The office is required to investigate any fatal incidents involving a police officer during an encounter or while a person was in police custody,</span> <span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>Planet Princeton</span></a></span><span> reported.</span></li></ul><p><b>It was a mistake:</b><span> Chin had just tied the knot with his partner in June, his mother, 74-year-old Ann Chin, told </span><span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>NJ Advance Media</span></a></span><span>.

I just can’t comprehend someone went into the house and opened fire.”</span></li><li><span>Born in New Mexico in 1978, Chin’s Taiwanese immigrant parents came to the U.S. as graduate students. He also has an older brother named Victor, whom Ann said was very close to him.</span></li><li><span>He grew up in a high-achieving family, and Ann Chin said he did very well academically. Chin graduated high school in Voorhees, Pennsylvania, and later attended Rutgers in New Jersey, where he took up biology and computer science.</span></li><li><span>Chin was hired as an IT technical lead for Merck after college in 2000, and he went on to work at the company’s competitor Bristol Myers Squibb as an IT business process analyst in 2017.</span></li><li><span>“</span><span>When Patrick died, he died in the happiest state of his life,” Ann Chin said. “It’s just so hard for us to accept it. … I didn’t know what’s bothering him.”</span></li></ul><p><span>Featured Image via</span> <span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>Tony Webster</span></a></span><span> (</span><span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>CC BY-SA 4.0</span></a></span><span>)</span></p><h3>Support our Journalism with a Contribution</h3><p>Many people might not know this, but despite our large and loyal following which we are immensely grateful for, NextShark is still a small bootstrapped startup that runs on no outside funding or loans.</p><p>Everything you see today is built on the backs of warriors who have sacrificed opportunities to help give Asians all over the world a bigger voice.</p><p>However, we still face many trials and tribulations in our industry, from figuring out the most sustainable business model for independent media companies to facing the current COVID-19 pandemic decimating advertising revenues across the board.</p><p>We hope you consider making a contribution so we can continue to provide you with quality content that informs, educates and inspires the Asian community.<br><span class=donate_way><strong>Even a $1 contribution goes a long way.</strong></span> Thank you for everyone’s support.
