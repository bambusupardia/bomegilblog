In the year 2008, he invested a sum of 300,000 Rubles in the stocks of 5 oil and gas companies which were Gazprom, Aurgutneftegar, Lukoil, Rosneft, and Gazprom Neft.

According to his blog, about 4 Billion Rubles were stolen by their leaders during the construction of the ‘Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline’. In December 2010, he announced the launch of a project titled ‘RosPil’ which seeks to bring to light the corrupt practices in the government procurement process.</p><p>In May 2011, he launched another project called ‘RosYama’ which means ‘Russian Hole’.

In August 2018, he alleged Victor Zoltov to have stolen about $29 Million for the National Guard of Russia from procurement contacts. Shortly after this, Navalny was jailed for staging protests and Viktor also posted a video message defaming Navalny.</p><p>In March 2017, Navalny and the FBKreleased the documentary titled ‘He is Not Dimon to You’ which accused Dmitry Medvedev, the Prime Minister and the former president of Russia of corruption.</p><p>On 26 March he organized some of the anti-corruption rallies across Russia. Some of which were sanctioned while others were not. Many were caught which lead to a protest in which according to Moscow police 500 people were detained while according to the human rights group OVD-info 1030 people including Navalny himself were detained in Moscow alone. Navalny was also fined 20,000 Rubles for organizing illegal protests and jailed for 15 days due to resisting arrest.&nbsp;</p><p>On 19 January 2021, an investigation was published by Navalny and FBK accusing Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia of using fraudulently obtained funds to build a huge estate for himself in Krasnodar Krai, near the town of Gelendzhik. He called it ‘the world’s biggest bribe’. According to the reports, the estate is 39 times that of Monaco and would cost over 100 Billion Rubles that is $1.35 Billion to construct. Navalny published very thorough details this time including blueprints and drone footages from the house. This gained about 20 Million views on YouTube in less than a day.</p><p>In the year 2000, he joined Yabloko, the Russian United Democratic Party. In 2001 he was listed as a member of Yabloko. In the year 2002, he was elected to the regional council of Moscow.

From April 2004 to February 2007, he remained at the Chief of Staff of the Moscow branch at Yabloko, and from 2006 to 2007 he was a member of the Federal Council of Yabloko.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/alexei-navalny-9.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>In August 2005, he took part as a candidate by incorporating himself into the Social Council of Central Administrative Okrug of Moscow, created before the Moscow city Duma election held later that year. In November 2005, he became one of the initiators of the Youth Public Chamber, which intended to help the younger politicians to take part in the legislative initiatives.</p><p>In 2005, he started a Youth Social Movement called ‘’DA! – Democratic Alternative’’. He later also organized TV debates through the state-run Moscow channel called TV Center. These 1st 2 episodes showed high ratings but then it was suddenly canceled.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Controversy></span><span id=Controversy>Controversy</span> <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On 20 June 2012, it was officially announced that Navalny’s people will develop a new political party. This one will be based on e-democracy. At that moment he declared it will not be part of the party. On 15 December 2012, he said ‘’The People’s Alliance is my Party’’. He said this but didn’t join in due to the criminal cases against him. After some obstacles, on 15 September he declared he would join and may head the party. On 17 November, he was elected as the leader of the party. Again there were obstacles in the registration. The party initiated a coalition of democratic parties on 17 April.</p><p>On 27 April 2017, he was attacked outside his office in the anti-corruption foundation. This was done by unknown assailants who sprayed brilliant green dye components on his face. In this, he lost 80% of his sight in the right eye.</p><p>He has been arrested several times by the Russian authorities and received 2 suspended sentences for embezzlement in 2 cases. Both were considered politically motivated to Barr him from running him in future elections.</p><p>On 20 August 2020, during a flight from Tomsk to Moscow, he was poisoned by a nerve agent and was rushed to the hospital in serious condition. No criminal investigation took place.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth></span><span id=Net_Worth>Net Worth</span> <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of the year 2022, Alexei Navalny’s net worth is $10 Million.

This was a shockingly huge number and this was achieved due to Navalny’s great impression, personality, and people’s faith in him. The campaign was given the tag ‘a a miracle’ by ‘The New Yorker’.</p><p>According to ‘The Economist’ and ‘Freedom House’, Navalny was the best contender to Vladimir Putin in the 2018 election.</p><h3>Related posts:</h3><a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Maddie Ziegler Net Worth, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Maddie Ziegler Net Worth, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Nicole TV Net Worth, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Nicole TV Net Worth, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Tony Lopez Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Tony Lopez Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Jordan Matter Net Worth, Age, Wife, Girlfriend, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Jordan Matter Net Worth, Age, Wife, Girlfriend, Family, Biography & More</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamZy7ornEm6CoZpOkunCty56vnqFdo663rcunsGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anne-whitfield-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Anne Whitfield Net Worth Phone Number, House Address, Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jupiter-pictures.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>25 Jupiter Pictures From The Juno Mission That'll Leave You In Awe</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./firefly-lane-timeline-what-years-do-the-show-take-place-in.html>'Firefly Lane' Timeline - What Years Do the Show Take Place In?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./funny-news-2018.html>14 Hilariously Funny News Stories You Missed In 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nazi-rise-to-power.html>36 Chilling Photos That Explain The Nazis' Rise To Power</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-horrifying-facts-regarding-lori-ann-slesinskis-murder.html>5 Horrifying Facts Regarding Lori Ann Slesinskis Murder</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-ahn-2.html>Ali Ahn Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaVibe.
