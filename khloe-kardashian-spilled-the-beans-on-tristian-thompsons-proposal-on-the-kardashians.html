The episode included several sweet moments amongst the Kardashians as they faced with controversy. However, one piece of news stunned both them and the audience. Khloe Kardashian confessed that she had turned down Tristian Thompson’s engagement prior to the paternity crisis.</p><p>The former couple began dating in 2016 and had a turbulent relationship while coping with many infidelity charges. The couple, who had a four-year-old daughter, True, and a two-month-old boy, allegedly divorced last year when it was found that Tristian had fathered a child with Maralee Nichols. During the inaugural episode of The Kardashians, viewers saw Khloe address the issue.</p><p>Khloe’s announcement stunned her fans. One user tweeted:</p><h2>Khloe’s announcement on The Kardashians regarding Tristian Thompson’s proposal</h2><p>Khloe shared information regarding her ex’s proposal that fans were unaware of on the September 29 episode of The Kardashians. The reality star talked out more about her sentiments after learning that the NBA player had cheated on her, and she shared her feelings with her sister, Kim Kardashian. She stated:</p><p>“We were in the finest position. So you go ahead and cheat on me while we’re at the pinnacle of our relationship? I don’t want to know what you did on the worst day of our relationship… I nearly feel like saying, ‘Shame on me.’ I should have known better, but I didn’t because I had so much hope and trust.”</p><p>Maralee filed a lawsuit against Tristan in December 2021, claiming that she was pregnant with his kid at the time. According to court records acquired by the tabloid, “he remembered his meeting with the fitness model while still dating Khloe.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Khloe-Kardashian-5.jpg alt="Khloe Kardashian" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After completing DNA testing, Tristian came to social media in January 2022 to confirm the news. He stated:</p><p>“Now that paternity has been proven, I am looking forward to raising our kid peacefully. I genuinely apologize to everyone I’ve harmed or disappointed both publicly and personally during this journey.”</p><p>Khloe revealed to Kim in Episode 2 of The Kardashians that Tristian proposed to her in December, before the issue broke. She went on to say that she had declined his proposal because she was unhappy with where they were in their relationship.</p><p>“I told her I needed to make sure this is a completely different relationship because I don’t want to be embarrassed to announce I’m engaged to anybody.” That’s why I stated, ‘I’m not sure I can take this since I’m not eager to tell my family.’ And, as painful as that was for him to hear, it was true. I’d never accept anything that would offer someone false hope.”</p><p>Khloe also discussed her choice not to share the news of her second child with the public because she wanted to keep it private. The rest of Season 2 was already filmed six months before the first episode, according to a statement released by the production team ahead of The Kardashians episode.</p><p>The creator of Good American said that she filmed the whole second season without disclosing any news or events in her life “simply because I wanted to keep it private and I wasn’t ready to discuss it.”&nbsp;While Kim was discussing with her sister how the family was worried about Khloe’s feelings throughout the incident, Khloe said that she wanted to “isolate herself,” adding that it was really difficult for her. The most difficult thing, she says, was “teaching yourself to un-love someone.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Khloe-Kardashian-4.jpg alt="Khloe Kardashian" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The Kardashians star went on:</p><p>“For six years, this was my life, and we weren’t simply a couple. He was my exercise companion and we were great friends. We accomplished everything jointly, so understanding how to undo everything takes time. You don’t fall out of love with someone just because they treat you badly.”</p><h2>Fans respond to Khloe Kardashian’s announcement.</h2><p>Fans flocked to social media to express their surprise at Tristian’s proposal and relief that Khloe turned it down. Check out their responses in the video below. Tristian contacted Kim Kardashian to tell her that he was going to propose to Khloe on Valentine’s Day 2020. Tristian, on the other hand, revealed that he proposed in December and that Khloe never informed the family about it.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>So glad Khloe said No to marrying him 😅🤣 <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#TheKardashians</a></p><p>— Kellie 🇦🇺 🐺 (@KellieBlock7) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">September 29, 2022</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Tristan PROPOSED to Khloe!?? omggg i’m so glad my girl didn’t accept that! <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">#TheKardashians</a></p><p>— 777mek (@jamekaabother) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">September 29, 2022</a></p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiioaSfmnqsrdGdmKygmZa7br%2FPoqOlnZRiwamxjJucmqajYryvedOroKysmZa7bsDHqKSpq5%2BjwG680ainqKuRoXqwuoytn55lm5a%2Fpa3SoaCapqNk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./klailea-bennett-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Klailea Bennett Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./justin-theroux.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Justin Theroux Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family &amp;amp; Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./firefly-lane-timeline-what-years-do-the-show-take-place-in.html>'Firefly Lane' Timeline - What Years Do the Show Take Place In?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./funny-news-2018.html>14 Hilariously Funny News Stories You Missed In 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nazi-rise-to-power.html>36 Chilling Photos That Explain The Nazis' Rise To Power</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-horrifying-facts-regarding-lori-ann-slesinskis-murder.html>5 Horrifying Facts Regarding Lori Ann Slesinskis Murder</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-ahn-2.html>Ali Ahn Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaVibe.
