Everyone is shocked by his sudden gain in attractiveness, which piques Eleanor‘s curiosity. She discusses her desire to pursue him after splitting from Trent with Devi and Fabiola. Devi avoids him despite agreeing that he is handsome and that Fabiola is not interested in boys. Ethan, though, shows interest in her when they cross paths.</p><p>Devi’s car is vandalized in the first episode. She initially thinks Margot, Ben‘s girlfriend, is responsible. Since Ben left Devi for Margot, they had a fight, and Devi said some harsh things about her. Devi discovers afterward that Ethan was responsible for the damage to her car. She observes that he writes the letter “t” in the same manner as the vandal.</p><p>When she questions him about it, he admits that he mistakenly thought the car belonged to a teacher who had given him poor marks. Devi warns him that if he doesn’t pay for repairs, he will ruin his skateboard. Ethan finds her attractive due to her hostility. He informs her about it when he arrives at her house with paint remover.</p><p>Even though Devi hadn’t previously considered it, Ethan’s interest in her prompts her to do so. In her dream about him, she also comes to the realization that dating him means betraying Eleanor, who wishes to date him. Because she loves Eleanor more than she does Ethan, Devi resolves to give up the idea of being with him. Ethan, though, pursues her during a party and gives her a kiss. They are interrupted by Eleanor, who informs Devi that he kissed her minutes before he kissed Devi.</p><p>Devi and Eleanor settle to avoid Ethan after realizing he had tricked them. Eleanor eventually stops trying to get him and lets Devi take him. He admits that he also likes Devi. Because of his glow-up, he had begun to attract girls’ attention and had grown ungrateful for it, so he kissed Eleanor. When Devi agrees to date him, he makes a commitment not to date any other girl.</p><p>Devi and Ethan begin making out and sleeping together all over Sherman Oaks High after their relationship becomes official. However, Devi gets warned against being with him by her friends and Ms. Warner. She expresses to Devi her desire for him to not drag her down with his bad boy habits. However, Devi assures Ms. Warner that she has everything in order. She even explains to Eleanor and Fabiola that Ethan is simply misunderstood.</p><p>Because she wants to be with Ethan, Devi keeps ignoring all the indications that he isn’t the right person for her. Devi realizes she can’t stay with him when he nearly jeopardizes her chances of getting into Princeton by taking the admissions representative’s purse. In the janitor’s closet at Sherman Oaks High, she splits up with Ethan. And he just disappears from the teenage series after the breakup scene.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianKq%2Fs7HDZqmemZyewbp6wqikaJ2kna6vec2erZ6qXZ2ut7GMomSerpWneqOxxaipnmWRo7FurcWtnKtn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bexzod-abduvaliev-died-a-tribute-to-a-bright-star-from-rit.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bexzod Abduvaliev Died: A Tribute to a Bright Star from RIT</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./underwater-nabataean-temple.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ancient Nabataean Temple Ruins Discovered Near Naples</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./firefly-lane-timeline-what-years-do-the-show-take-place-in.html>'Firefly Lane' Timeline - What Years Do the Show Take Place In?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./funny-news-2018.html>14 Hilariously Funny News Stories You Missed In 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nazi-rise-to-power.html>36 Chilling Photos That Explain The Nazis' Rise To Power</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-horrifying-facts-regarding-lori-ann-slesinskis-murder.html>5 Horrifying Facts Regarding Lori Ann Slesinskis Murder</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-ahn-2.html>Ali Ahn Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaVibe.
