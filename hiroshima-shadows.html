In their right hand they clutched a walking stick, their left may have been across their chest.</p><p>But seconds later, they were incinerated in the boiling light of an atomic bomb. In their place was a shadow that served as a horrifying relic of their final moments.</p><p>In fact, throughout the center of Hiroshima were a myriad of haunting outlines from window panes, valves, and even people in their last seconds. Etched on buildings and sidewalks now were the nuclear shadows of a city about to be obliterated.</p><p>They serve as macabre reminders of the hundreds of thousands who were lost in this unprecedented act of war.</p><h2>The Hiroshima Shadows And The Atomic Blast That Created Them</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-162385 alt="Nuclear Shadow On The Steps In Hiroshima" width=600 height=900 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/steps-hiroshima-shadows.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-162385 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Universal History Archive/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>The shadow of the Hiroshima resident seated on the Sumitomo bank steps.</span></p><p>When the atomic bomb “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Boy</a>” detonated 1,900 feet above the city, a flash of brilliant, boiling light scorched all that it touched. The surface of the bomb burned 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit and anything within 1,600 feet of its blast zone was incinerated in an instant. Anything within a mile radius of its impact site was reduced to rubble.</p><p>The heat from the explosion was so intense, in fact, that it also bleached everything in its blast zone, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">leaving</a> eerie nuclear shadows of human detritus where citizens once were.</p><p>The Sumitomo Bank was located just 850 feet from where Little Boy collided with the city of Hiroshima. Whoever was seated there had been obliterated.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-289261 alt="Nuclear Shadow Of Wheel In Hiroshima" width=800 height=630 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nuclear-shadow-of-wheel-in-hiroshima.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-289261 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>The intricate shadow of a knob on a pipeline.</span></p><p>According to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, the Hiroshima shadows weren’t <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">left</a> by people alone. Any object that was in the way of the blast was imprinted onto its background, including ladders, water main valves and bicycles.</p><p>Even if there was nothing in the way, the heat itself left behind imprints, marking the sides of the buildings with waves of heat and rays of light.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-289285 alt="Hiroshima Shadow Scorched Onto Stone Steps" width=605 height=509 data-sizes="(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/shadow-scorched-onto-stone-steps.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-289285 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The heat from the explosion burned the surface of the stone around the victim’s body.</span></p><p>Perhaps the most famous of the Hiroshima shadows is that of the person sitting on the bank steps. It is one of the most complete impressions left behind by the blast, and remained in place for over 20 years before it was removed and taken to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. Now, visitors can see the horrific Hiroshima shadows up close as the memorials to the horrors of nuclear weapons.</p><p>Depending on where these imprints were left, they have lasted anywhere between several to dozens of years before they were eventually eroded by rain and wind.</p><h2>The Aftermath Of The Bombing In Hiroshima</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-162383 alt="Atomic Bomb Shadows In Hiroshima" width=900 height=614 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bridge-hiroshima-shadows.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-162383 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>When the atomic bomb detonated over Hiroshima shadows formed as residents were vaporized where they stood and the nuclear blast bleached the materials around them. It appears that one person was protected by the body of another in their final seconds.</span></p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">aftermath in Hiroshima</a> was unprecedented. One-quarter of the city’s population perished in the blast and a second quarter died in the months that followed.</p><p>The city sustained damage up to three miles from the blast. Fires were ignited nearly four miles from the bomb’s hypocenter and glass shattered up to 12 miles.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-289282 alt="Nuclear Shadows On Window Panes" width=900 height=607 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nuclear-shadows-on-window-panes.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-289282 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>U.S. National Archives</span><span class=caption-body>The post office savings bank in Hiroshima features shadows from the atomic bomb’s scorching light.</span></p><p>The city of Hiroshima estimated that upwards of 200,000 people were killed in connection with the bombing, and largely due to a deadly combination of radiation poisoning and a lack of medical resources because the bomb detonated directly over a city hospital, killing a huge portion of its local doctors and supplies.</p><p>The events in Hiroshima that August day changed the world. Ninety percent of the city of Hiroshima was flattened, 80,000 people and counting were dead, and within days the emperor of Japan announced an unconditional surrender.</p><p>World War II came to a close and the whole of the globe was introduced to a terrifying new form of destruction.</p><p>After this look at the atomic bomb shadows left in Hiroshima, read about <a href=#>Tsutomu Yamaguchi, the man who survived both atomic bombs</a>.
