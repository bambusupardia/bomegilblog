According to reports, the worldwide press dubbed him “the next Susan Boyle” after viewing his performance with English subtitles.</p><p>As Choi Sung-bong’s reputation grew on ‘Korea’s Got Talent,’ other entertainment groups contacted him with contract offers.

He was managed by Bongbong Company till his tragic death in 2023.</p><h2>Was Choi Sung Bong a Gay or He Was Dating Anyone?</h2><p><strong>Choi Sung Bong’s</strong> sexual orientation has been described as gay throughout his career, rather than homosexual. Nonetheless, he was not rumored to be married and was most likely unmarried. Choi never mentioned his wife in any interview or on any of his social media accounts. He had a difficult upbringing. He was abandoned at the age of three and put in a Seoul orphanage, where he suffered physical abuse.
