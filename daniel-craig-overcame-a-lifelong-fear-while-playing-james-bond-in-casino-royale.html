Rumors of Craig leaving the role circulated for years, but he left the franchise on good terms. At least the casting backlash that followed him before 2006’s Casino Royale had abated.&nbsp;</p><p>When all was said and done, Craig’s 15 years playing Bond were longer than any other.&nbsp;</p><p>Sean Connery played the superspy first, acting in five Bond movies from 1962-67 before returning for Diamonds Are Forever in 1971. Roger Moore led seven movies in the series from 1973-85, but no one has approached Craig’s longevity as James Bond.</p><p>Casino Royale helped revive the Bond franchise, and it also helped Craig overcome his lifelong fear.</p><h2 id=h-craig-conquered-his-fear-of-heights-while-shooting-casino-royale>Craig conquered his fear of heights while shooting ‘Casino Royale’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=4><p></p><p><span>▶</span>” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/NMNlIj3CU28?feature=oembed” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></p></figure><p>The first post-opening credits scene in Casino Royale sees Bond in a parkour-heavy chase through a market and construction zone. Part of the chase takes place on the arm of a tower crane, and aside from some sequences where the stunt double fills in, Craig was the one running along the crane at great heights.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s not obvious on film, but Craig called the scene the most challenging of his tenure because of his lifelong fear of heights, as he revealed to GQ (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>):</p><p>“The crane sequence in Casino was one of the most challenging and fun scenes, because when I had started Casino Royale, I was afraid of heights. And after it, I wasn’t. So, I had to go up about 60 feet onto scaffolding and walk along beams that were about six inches across. No, run across beams that were six inches across 60 feet up in the air, which was — it wasn’t fun, but it was challenging.”</p><p>Daniel Craig</p><p>In the same video, Craig said Casino Royale is also responsible for some of his favorite stunts, especially the physicality he needed for the finale in the sinking house in Venice, Italy.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-who-will-play-james-bond-after-craig>Who will play ‘James Bond’ after Craig?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=4><p></p><p><span>▶</span>” src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/KK0Ulugv2UM?feature=oembed” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture” allowfullscreen></p></figure><p>Now that Craig has left the role behind and finishes his tenure <a href=#>near the top of the Bond rankings</a>, the question is, who’s next?</p><p>The answer is equally concise: Who knows?</p><p>As <a rel=noopener href=#>Esquire</a> noted, the list of actors who could play James Bond is about as long as the celluloid rolls from the previous 25 movies put together. The list includes certifiable stars such as Tom Hardy, Tom Holland, and Robert Pattinson, Briderton actors Tom Hopper and René-Jean Page, and a slew of British-born gentlemen.</p><p>One thing we do know is Bond will always be a man, according to producer Barbara Broccoli. However, as Esquire reported, she hasn’t even considered who will fill Craig’s shoes.&nbsp;</p><p>Craig conquered his fear, proved the doubters wrong, and finished as the longest-tenured Bond. Whoever is next to play the role has big shoes to fill.</p><p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=#><strong>Daniel Craig Once Joked About Being ‘Slightly Worried’ at the Idea of Quentin Tarantino Directing a James Bond Film</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOnZinoZWheqS%2BwKKeZqemmr%2BkrcyeZJplnJ6zprjOp55mnpWWv27Dx6KjnmWgoa66tc2gZKOZnZrAbq7Op5tmoZ5isKK%2FyKemZqqfrq6tsY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elizabeth-olsen-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Elizabeth Olsen Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chauncey-leopardi.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chauncey Leopardi Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./firefly-lane-timeline-what-years-do-the-show-take-place-in.html>'Firefly Lane' Timeline - What Years Do the Show Take Place In?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./funny-news-2018.html>14 Hilariously Funny News Stories You Missed In 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nazi-rise-to-power.html>36 Chilling Photos That Explain The Nazis' Rise To Power</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-horrifying-facts-regarding-lori-ann-slesinskis-murder.html>5 Horrifying Facts Regarding Lori Ann Slesinskis Murder</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-ahn-2.html>Ali Ahn Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaVibe.
