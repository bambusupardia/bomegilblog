Of course, this argument doesn’t work as well for the art pieces fashioned out of still-revered vintage novels. Although book upcycling is a controversial art, its physical beauty is undeniable.</p><img alt="Book Art Landscape" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/book-art-landscape.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>“It is recycling, but not just in the material sense; it’s a recycling of ideas, images, text, and textures from our cultural past.
