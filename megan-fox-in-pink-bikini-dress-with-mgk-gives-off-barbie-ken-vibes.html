Rapinoe and Co. will then travel to Chicago to face the Red Stars at SeatGeek Stadium on October 15.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>OL Reign head coach, Laura Harvey, included Rapinoe in her team’s starting line-up, with the 38-year-old named on the left wing, where she’s scored two goals and has registered 5 assists across 14 matches played this season. The Reign are the No. 6 seed of the NWSL – the last postseason birth – and just a point behind the Spirit – the No. 5 ranked team. They could be in serious danger of missing the playoffs if they lose against both, or either, Washington and Chicago.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Rapinoe will be hoping to win her last home game with her club after her time with the U.S. women’s national team ended abruptly in August. The forward was among three U.S. players to have missed a penalty kick in a Round of 16 loss to Sweden – the team’s worst-ever finish at the tournament in history.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Hey Megan! It’s Billie Jean [King],’ said the 12-time Grand Slam winner in a tribute video for Rapinoe shown prior to kick-off on Friday. ‘You’re a legend and a leader!
