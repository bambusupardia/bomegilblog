His efforts revealed a soccer ball-sized chunk of material left in the nodosaur’s stomach.</p><p>“The leaf fragments and other plant fossils were preserved down to the cells,” said David Greenwood, a biologist at Brandon University and co-author of the study.</p><p>The nodosaur, or Borealopelta markmitchelli, was an armored giant. Despite its massive weight, which could be over a ton, the nodosaur was a strict herbivore. And based on its stomach contents, its favorite vegetation was likely ferns.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-282473 alt="Nodosaur Stomach Fossil" width=900 height=526 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nodosaur-stomach-fossil.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-282473 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology </span><span class=caption-body>A closer look at the nodosaur’s stomach contents.</span></p><p>After comparing its stomach contents with fossil leaves from the same time period and territory, researchers noted that the nodosaur was a picky eater and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">preferred</a> the soft leaves from certain types of ferns.</p><p>“The lack of horsetails and rarity of cycads and conifers is surprising, given that these are very common in the surrounding flora,” said Caleb Marshall Brown, curator of dinosaur systematics and evolution at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. “Even within ferns, it looks like Borealopelta may have had a preference for certain types of ferns while ignoring others.”</p><p>In total, researchers found 48 microfossils of pollen and spores, moss and liverwort, 26 club mosses and ferns, two flowering plants, and 13 conifers.</p><p>The study also noted that were pieces of charcoal in the nodosaur’s stomach. This turned out to be consistent with its time period, as forest fires were a common occurrence during the early Cretaceous period and ferns, which were low to the ground, could survive.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-282475 alt="Nodosaur Fossil" width=900 height=601 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/nodosaur-fossil.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-282475 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Robert Clark/National Geographic</span><span class=caption-body>This nodosaur is among the best-preserved dinosaur specimens known to date.</span></p><p>Researchers estimated that a fire had indeed ravaged the grazing area of the nodosaur about six months before it ate its last meal in the spring or summer.</p><p>“The discovery of charcoal together with a fern-filled stomach… suggested Borealopelta was likely a keystone herbivore that shaped the landscape by its grazing, and that it also grazed on the ferns growing in open areas created by wildfires,” Greenwood said. “That is so cool.”</p><p>The study was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a> in the journal Royal Society Open Science in June 2020.</p><p>Next, checkout the newly-discovered dinosaur that was named <a href=#>‘star lizard’</a> in honor of David Bowie.
