brain cancer last October</a>, after capturing the hearts of New Zealand – spending her final weeks raising money for a cure she would not live to see.</p><p>Nearly $700k was eventually donated to Australian brain scientist Matt Dun, and Jemima was posthumously <a href=# rel=noopener>bestowed the New Zealand Herald’s 2021 Our Heroes award</a> for her selfless campaign.</p><p>Following “the worst year of their lives”, Jemima’s parents Ray and Oliver and their two sons departed for Europe shortly before Christmas, deciding they could no longer live with regrets.</p><img

was a real keen skiier so we went skiing in Italy, which would have been her dream,” her dad Oliver Gazley said.</p><p>“We’ve been dropping padlocks and coordinates – we did it in the Dolomites in the Italian Alps, and in Venice.</p><p>“We’re just thinking of places that we always talked about with her. I scattered some ashes while I was skiing in the Italian Alps on a fresh powder day, which was lovely.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/urvMkNcM1lF6ZmRk4P2veiMWu_s=/16x13/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/WCI3GC7V34INWN5VOIT7J3KYWU.jpg"><p>An aspiring baker, Jemima had dreamed of eating pastries in Paris, where the family also planned to visit in the coming months.</p><p>“Just all the places we always talked about as a family, and the things we thought we would do as a family,” Oliver said.</p><p>“I guess you can’t live with the regrets anymore, no matter what it is – we’re doing it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/ChXEOZ8RMMdenbtoYWL4t50bBK8=/16x20/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/GVOQPECNNXVIF2TMI6VFLAOMYE.jpg"><p>As Jemima had always dreamed of travelling Europe, Oliver said they had hoped to take their once-in-a-lifetime trip after she was first diagnosed last February, but soon realised this would not be possible with her condition.</p><p>Facing the Christmas period in their Wellington home, the Gazleys had decided to take the trip they had wanted to do with Jem.</p><p>Coming from New Zealand to Europe at the beginning of the Omicron outbreak had been a fascinating comparison, Oliver said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/Hgir2kdJ-b4_l0zaQKXtI2Bk_8A=/16x12/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/PLQMG76TOYQAQWYY37K2TEIP4Y.jpg"><p>“It’s kind of fascinating seeing it from this side of the world because everything is normal here,” he said.</p><p>“We all wear masks and we have to show our vaccination certificates to go to restaurants. But everything else is just normal.”</p><p>The family had travelled through Italy and Portugal and said both countries were completely open for the fully vaccinated, with rapid antigen tests widely available.</p><p>“The thing that threw me the most was when we left New Zealand and landed in Italy, in Venice, we just walked straight through the airport – picked up our bags and walked out the other side.</p><p>“There was no temperature check … it was just straight into the country.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/4i84bnHZrqwJTA8l71VcSNDik6E=/16x22/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/TYYZ6JAX6SMEY7GIRH65ATJXAU.jpg"><p>A country of around 10 million and a similar size to New Zealand, Portugal was seeing 30,000 to 50,000 cases a day, he said.</p><p>“We’ve just moved to Portugal and Portugal is even more relaxed – there’s still 30,000 cases here a day, but life is just normal.”</p><p>“I don’t know if that’s the right thing to do but it just seems right. Everyone’s getting on with it – it’s not ever going to go away, so we need to learn to live with it.”</p><p>With New Zealand’s borders still shut and no end in sight for MIQ, the Gazleys planned to continue travelling where the world is open.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnp6TCrbCMoZivnV2Xsqa6jKGcq2WUp7KiuYyjnKahnZZ6qK3ZpZyyZaKauqa5wZ6pnpxdpLtuwMeeZKKskaG2orqMmqOpq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./prolific-serial-killers-murderers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>11 Brutal Murderers And Prolific Serial Killers You Don't Know</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./revolutionary-high-court-term-on-abortion-guns-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Revolutionary' high court term on abortion, guns and more</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./firefly-lane-timeline-what-years-do-the-show-take-place-in.html>'Firefly Lane' Timeline - What Years Do the Show Take Place In?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./funny-news-2018.html>14 Hilariously Funny News Stories You Missed In 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nazi-rise-to-power.html>36 Chilling Photos That Explain The Nazis' Rise To Power</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-horrifying-facts-regarding-lori-ann-slesinskis-murder.html>5 Horrifying Facts Regarding Lori Ann Slesinskis Murder</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-ahn-2.html>Ali Ahn Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaVibe.
