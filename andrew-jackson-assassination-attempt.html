The scrappy president from Tennessee had been a boy when the Revolutionary War broke out, and he cut his teeth fighting against the British. When he was captured in 1781, a British soldier slashed him for refusing to shine his boots, giving Jackson scars on his hand and face. As an adult, Jackson survived a duel that left him with a bullet in his chest, and he was once shot so badly during a Nashville street brawl that he almost lost one of his arms.</p><p>Nothing quite compared, however, to the moment that Jackson survived an assassination attempt in Washington, D.C. on January 30, 1835.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-492383 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/andrew-jackson.jpeg alt="Andrew Jackson Assassination Attempt" width=610 height=739 sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-492383 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>Andrew Jackson was a controversial president and the first to be targeted for assassination.</span></p><p>At that point, no U.S. president had ever been the target of an <a href=# rel=noopener>assassination attempt</a> before. But Andrew Jackson was unlike any other president in American history. Though he’d become a hero during the War of 1812, Jackson was a deeply polarizing figure from the start.</p><p>In the election of 1824, the politically inexperienced and uneducated Jackson cut a different figure than his competitors, including John Quincy Adams — the Secretary of State and the son of a former president, John Adams. Despite this, Jackson ran a surprisingly popular campaign and only lost the race to Adams when it was thrown to the House of Representatives after none of the candidates garnered a majority of the electoral vote. Jackson accused Adams of striking a “corrupt bargain” and ran again in 1828.</p><p>This time he won — to the abject horror of many in the political establishment.</p><p>As president, Jackson pursued a number of divisive policies, from removing high-ranking government officials who he claimed were corrupt (and replacing them with his supporters) to his opposition to rechartering the Second Bank of the United States.</p><p>Many of Jackson’s policies were so controversial, in fact, that his detractors (led by Kentucky Senator Henry Clay) formed a new political party. They called themselves the “Whigs,” which prompted a direct comparison to the English anti-monarchy party of the same name. It also prompted a comparison between King George III of Britain, the hated British monarch who’d ruled during the Revolutionary War, and Andrew Jackson, who was dubbed “King Andrew” by his opponents.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-492385 alt="King Andrew Jackson" width=700 height=994 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/king-andrew.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-492385 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Public Domain</span><span class=caption-body>An 1832 cartoon depicting Jackson as “King Andrew.”</span></p><p>With political vitriol swirling in the air, Andrew Jackson became the obsession of a mentally disturbed house painter named Richard Lawrence, who took it upon himself to kill the 67-year-old president on a cold January day in Washington, D.C. But though Lawrence was armed with two pistols, and Jackson only with a cane, the president survived.</p><p>This is the story of the assassination attempt against Andrew Jackson, and how the president beat the odds — yet again — to live another day.</p><p class=.post-content>Learn more about the <a href=#>music</a> used in our podcast.
