Bush and grandfather of George W., is a Bonesman. He, along with his cohorts, was a member of an elite club at Yale University known as the Skull and Bones Society.</p><p>Throughout history, some of the most prominent American figures have been Bonesmen, handpicked members of Yale’s undergraduate class selected to join the ranks of elite students. In addition to the Bush’s — both H.W. and W. followed in Prescott’s footsteps during their time at the university — members have included hundreds of government officials, such as former Secretary of State John Kerry, as well as members of the entertainment industry, such as actor Paul Giamatti.</p><p>Aside from notable alumni, and a few legends, not much is known about the elusive society.</p><p>Founded in 1832, 131 years after Yale University opened its doors, the society was founded after some of the existing societies fell into conflict over an awards ceremony. To stop the conflict and reach a conclusion, members from the Linonia, the Brothers in Unity, and the Calliopean societies diverged from their respective groups and formed the Skull and Bones society.</p><p>William Huntington-Russel and Alphonso Taft took it upon themselves to create the society, and along with 12 other members, formed the inaugural class. Since 1832, every spring the society chooses fifteen new members from the junior class, including women in the process only since the early ’90s. Among those considered are leaders on campus, and notable names the society believes it could benefit from in the future.</p><p>The initiation process of the society has been long shrouded in secrecy, driving many to believe that it involves occult practices, black magic, and even animal sacrifices.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-141694 alt="Headquarters of the Skull and Bones" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/tomb-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-141694 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Skull and Bones Hall, also known as The Tomb, the headquarters of the Skull and Bones Society.</span></p><p>Like all societies at the university (of which there are seven), the Skull and Bones society have a headquarters. Known colloquially as the Tomb, the Skull and Bones Hall is a gothic, windowless building on High Street, just off campus, where the members can gather for meetings and events.</p><p>It is also the rumored resting place of the bones of Geronimo, after being stolen by Prescott Bush, as well as the skulls of former president Martin Van Buren and Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa.</p><p>In addition to the Tomb, the society also owns Deer Island, a small plot of land in the St. Lawrence River. The purpose of the island, described as run down and relatively derelict, is to be a retreat, a place where the members can go for the weekend to “rekindle old friendships.”</p><p>Due to the secrecy and elitism <a href=# rel=noopener>promoted</a> by the society, the Skull and Bones Society, as well as the Bonesmen, have long been the subject of conspiracy theories.</p><p>Some claim that the group was behind the Kennedy assassination, that they were responsible for creating the nuclear bomb, that they are sponsored and influenced by the Illuminati, and even that they control the entire Central Intelligence Agency.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-141695 alt="Presidents From Secret Societies" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pres.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-141695 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Presidents Taft, H.W. Bush and W. Bush were all members of the Skull and Bones Society.</span></p><p>However, the theories, as off-kilter as some of them may sound, aren’t really that off base when considering the members.</p><p>At different points throughout history, Bonesmen have had control over the fortunes of the Rockefellers, the Carnegies, and the Fords. They’ve also had members rise through the ranks and obtain high offices in the Council on Foreign Relations, powerful media corporations such as Time, and, of course, three Presidents of the United States (William Howard Taft, in addition to the Bushs).</p><p>In fact, during the 2004 Presidential Election, both the Republican and Democratic nominees, John Kerry and George W. Bush, were Skull And Bones members.</p><p>Despite the theories and accusations surrounding them, Bonesmen have remained notoriously silent about what goes on in their inner sanctum. Both Kerry and Bush were asked about life as Bonesmen during the 2004 election, but neither would comment.</p><p>“It’s a secret,” Kerry said, adding nothing more.</p><p>“So secret, I can’t say anything more,” W. Bush added in his autobiography.</p><p>It could be that the members of the society really are plotting to take over the world, or it could be that there’s actually nothing going on inside the Tomb worth noting, and the members simply enjoy being the subject of insane theories.</p><p>Hundreds of books, documentaries, and television specials have been released n an attempt to learn more about the inner workings of the Skull And Bones society, but it seems that the only way to learn anything worthwhile is to become a member yourself.</p><p>After learning about the Skull And Bones society, read about the secret lives of some of the <a href=#>most well known historical figures</a>. Then, read about the <a href=#>secret chamber in King Tut’s tomb</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony0t9Slo2aZnpl6o7vNnqpmq5%2BYtqbA2A%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jailynn-griffin.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tyrone Dollas Daughter Jailynn Griffin: Mother, Age, Instagram, Relationship, Net Worth!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./susan-lucci-age-and-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Susan Lucci Age And Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./firefly-lane-timeline-what-years-do-the-show-take-place-in.html>'Firefly Lane' Timeline - What Years Do the Show Take Place In?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./funny-news-2018.html>14 Hilariously Funny News Stories You Missed In 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nazi-rise-to-power.html>36 Chilling Photos That Explain The Nazis' Rise To Power</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-horrifying-facts-regarding-lori-ann-slesinskis-murder.html>5 Horrifying Facts Regarding Lori Ann Slesinskis Murder</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-ahn-2.html>Ali Ahn Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaVibe.
