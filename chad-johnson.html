Chad, on the other hand, transferred to Oregon State University. Coach Dennis Erickson later recruited him to play for the OSU team.</p><p>Furthermore, he began his football career at this university.

She suggested Chad move to Los Angeles to live with his mother and attend Santa Monica College, which had a strong football program. Similarly, after joining, he played for the Corsairs in 1997, alongside Steve Smith, a future All-Pro receiver who was also flying under the radar in college football. Eugene Sykes was also a member of the team that later found a home in the Arena Football League.

Similarly, in his early years, he had 28 passes for 329 yards and one touchdown. Furthermore, in 2003, Chad set a Bengals franchise record with 1,355 receiving yards.

Similarly, he led the AFC in receiving yards for four consecutive seasons, and from 2003 to 2007, he made the Pro Bowl five times in a row. Similarly, Chad created a checklist called ‘Covered 85′ in 2005 to evaluate his defensive backs’ ability to cover him. Furthermore, the Bengals’ head coach replaced the list with ‘Did 85.’</p><p>It was primarily intended to antagonize the Bengals’ divisional rivals, and they would use to play against the Baltimore Ravens. In 2007, search engines such as Degree and Yahoo even created an online checklist that allowed fans to vote Chat while the match was being played. Furthermore, the vote raised funds for the charity project ‘Feed the Children.’</p><p>In addition, after being injured during the game, he spent the first half of 2006 resting. However, after shaving his hair into a Mohawk, he changed his mindset and came out in a breakout game against the San Diego Chanters in a losing effort. He had 260 receiving yards and two touchdowns, breaking the Bengals’ record for receiving yards in a game. Chad also set an NFL record with 450 receiving yards in back-to-back games, breaking the previous mark of 448 yards in consecutive games. Furthermore, he broke the previous record of 448 set in 1989 by San Francisco 49ers receiver John Taylor. Furthermore, Chad broke the three-game receiving record set by the NFL-AFL merger in 1970.

Similarly, he accumulates 209 yards on 11 catches for two touchdowns in a 51-45 loss to the Cleveland Browns. Furthermore, Chad gained 7229 yards in this game, breaking the previous franchise record set by Issac Curtis in the Bengals. However, the Bengals lost their next game against the Seattle Seahawks, despite Chad’s nine receptions for 138 yards. However, he gained 102 yards and added a 15-yard rush to help the Bengals defeat the New York Jets 38-31.</p><p>Chad was also named to the 2008 Pro Bowl team, along with T.J. Houshamandzadeh. This was his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl selection, giving the Bengals two Pro Bowl appearances in the same year. Chad, on the other hand, spoke to the media about how he was treated during the 2007 season. In an interview with ESPN’s Mike & Mike radio show, he stated, “I was labeled selfish and cancer, and it hurt… This year, fingers were pointed at me. If the team and the organization are to progress, I believe you must resolve the issue… It was painful for me. To treat me in that manner and not have my back. Things were said, and no one defended me.’ Similarly, Chad had many disagreements with his teammates, such as Chris Mortensen, after feeling betrayed.</p><p>Furthermore, he legally alters his name to Chad Ochocinco. Ochocinco is a Spanish translation of the number 85, which is written as ‘ochenta y cinco.’ In the year 2012, it was changed back to Chad Johnson. However, 2008 turns out to be a difficult year. In the first four games of the season, he only had 11 receptions for 116 yards and a touchdown. Following a poor performance against the Dallas Cowboys in a loss, he was unable to gain more than 37 yards.</p><p>Furthermore, the Bengals defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 21-19 in their first game of the season in week 9.

Chad also finished his seventh career 1000-yard season, catching 72 passes for 1047 yards and nine touchdowns. Similarly, he fell 48 yards short of the 10,000-yard receiving yardage mark this season, and his 62 career touchdown catches tied Carl Pickens’ franchise record. In addition, Chad became the 30th player in NFL history to surpass 700 career receptions in 2010. In addition, he passed for 44 yards in a 15-10 victory.</p><h2>Chad Johnson Net Worth</h2><p><strong>How rich is Chad Johnson? </strong>During his 12-year NFL career, he has amassed a sizable fortune.
