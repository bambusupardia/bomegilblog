It is also known as a “friend of the court brief” that voices his support&nbsp;for first responders getting benefits for any mental and nervous injuries.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">JFRD firefighter Jerome Patterson is seeking medical benefits for mental or nervous injuries of PTSD.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">He has already been denied twice.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“There is definitely a powerful psychological burden that comes from the trauma that these men and women experience,” Patronis said.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Randy Wyse, Jacksonville Association of Firefighters Union Chief, agrees.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“Firefighters are exposed to horrific scenes on a regular basis,” Wyse wrote in a statement to News4JAX. “Our state legislators and governor recognized that due to these high-stress jobs, firefighters should receive workers’ compensation benefits when they receive a mental injury. The Jacksonville Association of Firefighters supports our brother in receiving the medical benefits he deserves.”</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">The document Patronis filed&nbsp;shows his interest in the case without being involved in the litigation.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Court documents show Patterson&nbsp;was&nbsp;first diagnosed with PTSD in 2015, following&nbsp;a triple-murder suicide in Oceanway he responded to.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Twin babies along with their grandfather were shot and killed.

He says the intent was to expand PTSD care and coverage, not limit it. He believes that is getting misconstrued on the local level.</p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“I know what the interpretation of the law is,” Patronis said. “I know what the intent of the law is and when the law is under attack,&nbsp;I feel like it is my job to stand up and fight for it. We are not trying to weigh in on the character of any of the individuals. We are not trying to be critical of any of the parties. We are just saying that this is the law that was passed by the Florida legislature. This is how we interpreted it on how it is supposed to work.”</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-htpNat dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Patterson is appealing the judge’s decision to the Florida first court of appeals.</p><p>Copyright 2022 by WJXT News4JAX – All rights reserved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnmpu%2FpXnFoqmenpmctbWx0WaZmqykobavs4yfpqtloKnApXnBnqWenpmpwG6zxK2qZpqRmLiqusZmnaunnWLAta3TnmSlnZGZsrN7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./johnny-depp-once-said-iggy-pop-calling-him-a-turd-was-1-of-the-best-moments-of-my-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Johnny Depp Once Said Iggy Pop Calling Him a Turd 'Was 1 of the Best Moments of My Life'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jonathan-larson-death.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Inside Jonathan Larson's Death From Undiagnosed Marfan Syndrome</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./firefly-lane-timeline-what-years-do-the-show-take-place-in.html>'Firefly Lane' Timeline - What Years Do the Show Take Place In?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./funny-news-2018.html>14 Hilariously Funny News Stories You Missed In 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nazi-rise-to-power.html>36 Chilling Photos That Explain The Nazis' Rise To Power</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-horrifying-facts-regarding-lori-ann-slesinskis-murder.html>5 Horrifying Facts Regarding Lori Ann Slesinskis Murder</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-ahn-2.html>Ali Ahn Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaVibe.
