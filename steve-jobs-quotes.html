Don’t be trapped by dogma, which is living the result of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of other opinions drown your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition, they somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.</span> <img alt="Steve Jobs On Settling" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/dont-settle.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it.</span> <img alt="Figure Out Whats Next" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/figure-out-whats-next.png> <span class=caption-body>I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what’s next.</span> <img alt="Getting Fired" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/getting-fired.png> <span class=caption-body>I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.</span> <img alt="Steve Jobs On Innovation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/steve-jobs-on-innovation.png> <span class=caption-body>Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.</span> <img alt="Give Them What They Want" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/give-them-what-they-want.png> <span class=caption-body>You can't just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them.

It's very crude today, yet our Macintosh computer takes less power than a 100-watt bulb to run it and it can save you hours a day. What will it be able to do ten or 20 years from now, or 50 years from now?</span> <img alt="Most Precious Resource" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/most-precious-resource.png> <span class=caption-body>My favorite things in life don't cost any money.

Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.</span> <img alt="Steve Jobs Model For Business" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/steve-jobs-model-for-business.png> <span class=caption-body>My model for business is The Beatles. They were four guys who kept each others kind of negative tendencies in check. They balanced each other, and the total was greater than the sum of the parts. That's how I see business: Great things in business are never done by one person, they're done by a team of people.</span> <img alt="On Being A Consumer Company" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/on-being-a-consumer-company.png> <span class=caption-body>Our DNA is as a consumer company - for that individual customer who's voting thumbs up or thumbs down. That's who we think about. And we think that our job is to take responsibility for the complete user experience. And if it's not up to par, it's our fault, plain and simply.</span> <img alt="Revolutionary Change" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/revolutionary-change.png> <span class=caption-body>I have a great respect for incremental improvement, and I've done that sort of thing in my life, but I've always been attracted to the more revolutionary changes.

And you usually go through a period where everybody tells you that you've completely failed.</span> <img alt="Steve Jobs Quotes On Money" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/steve-jobs-quotes-on-money.png> <span class=caption-body>Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we've done something wonderful, that's what matters to me.</span> <img alt="Steve Jobs On Creativity" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/steve-jobs-on-creativity.png> <span class=caption-body>Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.</span> <img alt="Steve Jobs On Design" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/steve-jobs-on-design.png> <span class=caption-body>Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.

It’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.</span> <img alt="Steve Jobs Quotes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/steve-jobs-quotes.png> <span class=caption-body>We don’t get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent. Because this is our life. Life is brief, and then you die, you know? And we’ve all chosen to do this with our lives. So it better be damn good. It better be worth it.</span> <img alt="Steve Jobs Quotes On Changing Something" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/steve-jobs-quotes-on-changing-something.png> <span class=caption-body>For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: 'If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?' And whenever the answer has been 'No' for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</span> <img alt="Steve Jobs Quotes Successful Entrepreneurs" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/steve-jobs-quotes-successful-entrepreneurs.png> <span class=caption-body>I'm convinced that about half of what separates successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.</span> <img alt="Technology Is Nothing" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/technology-is-nothing.png> <span class=caption-body>Technology is nothing. What's important is that you have a faith in people, that they're basically good and smart, and if you give them tools, they'll do wonderful things with them.</span> <img alt="Steve Jobs On Being Creative" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/being-creative.png> <span class=caption-body>If you want to live your life in a creative way, as an artist, you have to not look back too much. You have to be willing to take whatever you’ve done and whoever you were and throw them away.</span> <img alt="Trust In Something" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/trust-in-something.png> <span class=caption-body>You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.</span> <img alt="The Aesthetic" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/the-aesthetic.png> <span class=caption-body>When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will see it. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.</span> <img alt="Thinking Simply" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/thinking-simply.png> <span class=caption-body>That’s been one of my mantras — focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex; you have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.</span> <img alt="Steve Jobs Quotes On Innovation" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/when-you-innovate.png> <span class=caption-body>Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes.
