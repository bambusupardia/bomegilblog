The elaborate bronze bed, which dates to the first century B.C.E., suggests the remains belonged to someone with high standing in the community — perhaps even royalty.</p><p>The surrounding area in West Macedonia has been continually inhabited since 6500 B.C.E. But 2,100 years ago, when this mysterious woman was buried, big changes were taking place in Greece. Roman influence was growing. In 48 B.C.E., Julius Caesar defeated Pompey’s armies at the Battle of Pharsalus to become the leader of Rome — and he soon turned his eyes toward Greece.</p><p>Whether or not the recently unearthed woman was alive during the country’s political changes is unclear, but considering her seemingly important role in society, it’s likely she at least would have been aware of the major events as they unfolded.</p><p>The woman’s funerary bed itself is remarkably intact, though the wooden portions have decomposed over the centuries. The bronze posts are covered in depictions of mermaids, which were well-established in Greek lore by the first century B.C.E.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Greek Reporter</a>, the first known tales of mermaids date to Assyria in 1000 B.C.E. The goddess Atargatis was said to have fallen in love with a mortal man, but she accidentally killed him. Out of shame, she jumped into a lake, where she turned into a fish from the waist down.</p><p>In ancient Greek mythology, Sirens were half-woman, half-bird creatures who sat on rocky seashores and sang beautiful songs to lure in sailors, causing shipwrecks. They most famously appear in Homer’s Odyssey, when the sorceress Circe warns <a href=# rel=noopener>Odysseus</a> that he must resist their song.</p><p>As the story goes, Odysseus ordered his crew to tie him to the ship’s mast and plug their own ears with beeswax. As they traveled past the Sirens, Odysseus heard their song and begged his crew to untie him, but they ignored him as ordered and continued safely past the perilous shore.</p><p>By the turn of the millennium, though, Greek depictions of mermaids had come closer to the beautiful, fish-tailed women they’re known as today.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-381609 alt="Bronze Bed Model" width=900 height=617 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/bronze-bed-model.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-381609 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Areti Chondrogianni-Metoki</span><span class=caption-body>A model of the 2,100-year-old bronze bed discovered in Greece.</span></p><p>In addition to the mermaids, the 2,100-year-old bed contains a bronze engraving of a bird with a snake in its mouth, which was a symbol of Apollo, the ancient Greek god of music, prophecy, and healing. Areti Chondrogianni-Metoki, the director of the Ephorate of Antiquities of Kozani, told <a href=# rel=noopener>Live Science</a>, “We do not know much about the history of this area,” but it is clear that there was a sanctuary dedicated to Apollo in nearby Mavropigi.</p><p>Thus, Chondrogianni-Metoki believes that the deceased may have had a connection to the cult of Apollo.</p><p>Other signs on this recently-discovered skeleton, however, suggest additional possibilities. While scientists are still working to determine how old the woman was and how she died, they do know she had a high social and political position in society, as she was buried alone.</p><p>There were gold threads on her hands, likely from embroidery, and her head was covered in gold laurel leaves that were part of a wreath she was wearing when she was laid to rest. In addition to the funerary bed, archaeologists found four clay pots and a glass vessel buried alongside her.</p><p>Chondrogianni-Metoki previously told <a href=# rel=noopener>Ekathimerini</a>, “Bed burials were common practice in Hellenistic times.” But the bronze funerary bed is the first of its kind to be found, so it’s evident that this woman was special.</p><p>Whether these newly-discovered remains are those of a royal family member or a high priestess is yet to be determined, but archaeologists are eager to learn as much as they can about this exceedingly rare find.</p><p>After reading about the bronze funerary bed unearthed in Greece, read about the Greek farmer who stumbled upon a <a href=#>3,400-year-old Minoan tomb</a> in his olive grove. Then, go inside these stories of <a href=#>mermaid sightings</a> throughout the centuries.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyurdWrpqmhl556rrHRppiinF2XsqU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ashley-tisdale-wishes-best-friend-austin-butler-happy-30th-birthday.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ashley Tisdale Wishes 'Best Friend' Austin Butler Happy 30th Birthday!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./anthony-varrecchia.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Anthony Varrecchia- Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./firefly-lane-timeline-what-years-do-the-show-take-place-in.html>'Firefly Lane' Timeline - What Years Do the Show Take Place In?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./funny-news-2018.html>14 Hilariously Funny News Stories You Missed In 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nazi-rise-to-power.html>36 Chilling Photos That Explain The Nazis' Rise To Power</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-horrifying-facts-regarding-lori-ann-slesinskis-murder.html>5 Horrifying Facts Regarding Lori Ann Slesinskis Murder</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-ahn-2.html>Ali Ahn Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaVibe.
