Prosecutors argued she was a flight risk because she is from all the way out in Merritt Island, Florida, and she did not turn herself in. A witness recognized her on the street and called police, they said.</p><p>Barker’s defense lawyer asserted the case was “amplified by media sensation.”</p><p>Judge <strong>Eric Schumacher&nbsp;</strong>nonetheless set bail at $20,000 cash, or $20,000 of a partially secured bond. Barker faces a hate crimes case.</p><p>Police have said that a woman–then unknown–“made xenophobic remarks and discharged pepper spray at 4 female victims,” at the corner of 9th Avenue and West 14th Street.

That was when a stranger–Barker–cursed them out and used pepper spray on them completely unprovoked, they said. The situation started when she had her back to them while sitting on one of the large stones along 9th Avenue, they said. She claimed the women were trying to harass her, one of them said.</p><p>Another insisted thy were not trying to bother her.</p><p>One of them even offered an apology.</p><p>“Like I’m sorry, I didn’t intend to make you feel that way,” she said.</p><p>They started to record when she began going on a racist rant and took out pepper spray.</p><p>“Saying like, go back to where you came from, you don’t belong here,” one woman said. “She pointed to an Asian bystander who was a man, we didn’t know who he was, pointed at him and said take your [expletive] back to your country.”</p><p>One of the women said she could not open her eyes for about 30 minutes because of the pepper spray.</p><p>[Image via New York Police Department]</p><p>Have a tip we should know? <a href=#><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=582c31282b1834392f39363c3b2a31353d763b3735>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX2d9cXyPZpmaoZxiwKbAjJ%2Bmq2WdlrGmuMinnGaakae4pr6MoqVmmZ6ptm6t0qKYp2WRqcGir8po</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./prehistoric-animals.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>11 Prehistoric Animals So Terrifying You Won't Believe They Were Real</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./yelawolf.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Yelawolf Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./firefly-lane-timeline-what-years-do-the-show-take-place-in.html>'Firefly Lane' Timeline - What Years Do the Show Take Place In?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./funny-news-2018.html>14 Hilariously Funny News Stories You Missed In 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nazi-rise-to-power.html>36 Chilling Photos That Explain The Nazis' Rise To Power</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-horrifying-facts-regarding-lori-ann-slesinskis-murder.html>5 Horrifying Facts Regarding Lori Ann Slesinskis Murder</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-ahn-2.html>Ali Ahn Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaVibe.
