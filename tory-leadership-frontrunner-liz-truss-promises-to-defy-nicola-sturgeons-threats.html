I wanted to highlight Rishi’s misguided sartorial style in order to alert Tory members not to be taken in by appearances in the way that happened to many of us who served with the Chancellor in Cabinet.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She then makes an extraordinary jibe at Mr Sunak’s height (5ft 7in), saying: ‘The assassin’s gleaming smile, his gentle voice and even his diminutive stature had many of us well and truly fooled.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In a scathing verdict on Mr Sunak’s alleged plotting, she adds: ‘His actions made Michael Gove’s betrayal of Boris Johnson during the 2016 leadership campaign appear like a rank amateur rehearsing for the role of Brutus in a village-hall play.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Meanwhile, Ms Truss’s leadership ambitions have also been endorsed by leading anti-woke Tory MP Sir John Hayes, who hailed her ‘character and determination’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Speaking to the MoS, Sir John – chairman of the influential Common Sense Group of Tory MPs and peers – singled out Ms Truss’s clear answer at a hustings in Leeds last week when she defended the return of single-sex toilets in schools after the introduction of same-sex spaces during the pandemic.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But he also saluted her belief in Britain: ‘What impresses me about Liz is that she is unprepared to accept the orthodoxy of decline.
