She was arrested on charges of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, solicitation to commit a capital felony, and child abuse, prosecutors said.</p><p>Her defense attorney Henry M. Coxe, III declined to comment.</p><p>Two co-defendants, Henry Tenon and Mario Fernandez Saldana — Gardner’s current husband — were arrested in the case earlier this year, prosecutors said in a <a href=# rel=noopener>news release</a>.</p><p>Tenon was a tenant of Fernandez Saldana’s. Tenon pleaded guilty to murder in the second degree with a weapon. He admitted to being the gunman and agreed to testify against those he had worked with to kill Bridegan, officials said.</p><p>Bridegan was shot&nbsp;while driving home after dropping off his 9-year-old twin children, whom he shared with Gardner, at the home she shared with Fernandez-Saldana.</p><p>His body was found with multiple gunshot wounds in the road along Sanctuary Boulevard in Jacksonville Beach shortly before 8 p.m. on Feb. 16, 2022.</p><p>He had stopped along that dark stretch of road that night when he encountered a tire in the middle of the street. When he got out of his SUV to remove the tire, he was shot several times in front of his 2-year-old, who was still strapped to a car seat in the back seat.</p><p>“This investigation has uncovered the truth of Jared’s murder,” said State Attorney Melissa Nelson in a statement. “Henry Tenon <a href=# rel=noopener>did not act alone</a>. Mario Fernandez did not plan alone. And Shanna Gardner’s indictment acknowledges her central and key role in the cold, calculated, and premeditated murder of Jared Bridegan.”</p><p>Gardner has <a href=# rel=noopener>denied any wrongdoing</a> in the murder. A company owned by Garnder’s parents has said that she and Fernandez Saldana separated.</p><p>The suspects face a count of child abuse because the shooting put Bridegan’s daughter in danger.</p><p>“Bullets struck the interior of the vehicle, in close proximity to where the child was strapped into her car, an act that reasonably could have been expected to cause physical or mental injury to her,” an affidavit stated. “Witnesses advised that the child was crying when they arrived on scene.”</p><p>Fernandez Saldana is scheduled for a hearing on Sept. 12. A judge has yet to sentence Tenon. He is scheduled for a status hearing on Oct. 9.</p><p>Alberto Luperon contributed to this report.</p><p>Have a tip we should know? <a href=#><span class=__cf_email__ data-cfemail=5d29342d2e1d313c2a3c33393e2f343038733e3230>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8KroKadX6i1orrNmmSgmaKZu6a%2BjJ%2Bcq6aRo7Gmxoyaqaudo6mypXnIp2SjmaKasW6u0aKbnp%2BRo3quwdGdnKtn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./starfield-enhance-location-how-to-change-appearance-at-a-genetics-lab.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Starfield Enhance Locations: How to Change Appearance at a Genetics Lab</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rish-shah.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rish Shah Height, Weight, Size, Body Measurements, Biography, Wiki, Age</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./firefly-lane-timeline-what-years-do-the-show-take-place-in.html>'Firefly Lane' Timeline - What Years Do the Show Take Place In?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./funny-news-2018.html>14 Hilariously Funny News Stories You Missed In 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nazi-rise-to-power.html>36 Chilling Photos That Explain The Nazis' Rise To Power</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-horrifying-facts-regarding-lori-ann-slesinskis-murder.html>5 Horrifying Facts Regarding Lori Ann Slesinskis Murder</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-ahn-2.html>Ali Ahn Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaVibe.
