In 1913, Roosevelt wrote a letter to eugenics supporter and biologist C.B. Davenport, saying that “society has no business to permit degenerates to reproduce their kind."</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Alexander Graham Bell</h2><span class=caption-body>Telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell helped lead the First International Eugenics Conference in 1912. Bell also published a paper in which he bluntly listed the steps that would prevent the proliferation of the deaf: “(1) Determine the causes that promote intermarriages among the deaf and dumb; and (2) remove them."</span><span class=credit>Kentucky Digital Library</span><h2 class=title>Helen Keller</h2><span class=caption-body>Even Helen Keller, surprisingly enough, advocated for the eugenics movement. She once stated, “Our puny sentimentalism has caused us to forget that a human life is sacred only when it may be of some use to itself and to the world."</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Winston Churchill</h2><span class=caption-body>Winston Churchill advocated for compulsory labor camps for mental defectives in 1911. The year prior to this, Churchill wrote a letter advocating for sterilization saying, "The unnatural and increasingly rapid growth of the Feeble-Minded and Insane classes ... constitutes a national and race danger which it is impossible to exaggerate."</span><span class=credit>levanrami/Flickr</span><h2 class=title>Margaret Sanger</h2><span class=caption-body>Activist Margaret Sanger opened the first birth control clinic and she aligned her fight for contraception with the eugenics movement. She stated that “birth control is nothing more or less than the facilitation of the process of weeding out the unfit [and] of preventing the birth of defectives."</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>W. E. B. Du Bois</h2><span class=caption-body>Harvard-educated sociologist W. E. B.

Unfortunately, he had no personal empathy for the disabled, as he addressed the separate problem of deformed children by remarking, “Chloroform unfit children. Show them the same mercy that is shown beasts that are no longer fit to live."<p>However, in 1926 he wrote an essay called "The Eugenics Cult", in which he condemned the theory.</p></span><span class=credit>Library of Congress</span><h2 class=title>George Bernard Shaw</h2><span class=caption-body>Celebrated writer George Bernard Shaw explored the biology of eugenics in his political writing. He is quoted as saying, "We should find ourselves committed to killing a great many people whom we now leave living, and to leave living a great many people whom we at present kill." He added, "A great many people would have to be put out of existence simply because it wastes other people's time to look after them."</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Oliver Wendell Holmes</h2><span class=caption-body>Oliver Wendell Holmes, Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1902 to 1932, wrote the 1927 Buck v. Bell decision that allowed for compulsory sterilization of the "unfit" in the U.S., stating, “It is better for all the world, if instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for crime or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind. ... Three generations of imbeciles are enough."</span><span class=credit>Library of Congress</span><h2 class=title>Jacques Cousteau</h2><span class=caption-body>The famous French explorer Jacques Cousteau was in favor of population control —saying in an interview, “World population must be stabilized and to do that we must eliminate 350,000 people per day.

(Pauling had said carries of genetic diseases shouldn’t procreate.) He replied, "It's alright for her [a mother] to be allowed to determine the extent to which she will suffer, but she should not be allowed to produce a child who will suffer. This is immoral. It is wrong to produce a little black child who will lead a life of suffering. I would say this is not racism. I advocate the very same thing to ... all kinds who carry these abnormal genes."</span><span class=credit>Oregon State University/Flickr</span><h2 class=title>John Maynard Keynes</h2><span class=caption-body>Even after World War II, economist John Maynard Keynes supported eugenics, population control, and migration restrictions as Director of the British Eugenics Society.

In large part, he actually took inspiration from the United States. As <a href=# rel=noopener>Hitler remarked in 1924's Mein Kampf</a>, "There is today one state in which at least weak beginnings toward a better conception are noticeable. Of course, it is not our model German Republic, but the United States."</p><p>The popularity of eugenics and related ideas in the U.S. (as well as Western Europe) at the time was in part a reactionary response to increased industrialization and immigration. The latter was on the rise and cities became more crowded as people moved to be closer to work. And with supporters of the early eugenics movement believing that people inherited traits like feeble-mindedness and poverty, this meant to them that society had an obligation to thin this growing herd.</p><p>Moreover, Western eugenics was an outgrowth or racist and colonialist ideologies. Pseudosciences (like phrenology, for example) allowed some whites to "scientifically" justify their bigotry — and then take things a step further by claiming that "lesser" races needed to be phased out. In this way, <a href=# rel=noopener>Social Darwinism</a> became a means to construct a supposed hierarchy of race — and ensure that white people (and their genes) remained the ideal.</p><p>Fittingly enough, eugenics actually has some of its roots with Charles Darwin. His theories about "survival of the fittest" inspired his cousin, Francis Galton, to start the eugenics movement as the world would come to know it (and coin the word "eugenics" itself) in the late 19th century.</p><p>From there, eugenics actually enjoyed a period of mainstream popularity in both Darwin and Galton's native England as well as the U.S. and elsewhere in the late 19th century and early 20th. Both abroad and in the United States, proponents of the eugenics movement believed it a Caucasian responsibility to Westernize other civilizations. This was coupled with the idea of producing fewer, better children who would create a better race, and cure many economic and social problems.</p><p>Before Hitler took eugenics to its deadly extremes, more people than you might think considered at least some eugenics-related ideas to be completely legitimate — despite their serious moral implications. Eugenics was something that many prominent people once supported, whether vocally, financially, or politically. Presidents, economists, activists, and philosophers — many of which you'd never think would be supporters — all once spoke out in support of the eugenics movement.</p><p>See for yourself in the gallery above.</p><p>Next, dig deeper into the ugly <a href=#>history of American eugenics</a>.
