It would take more than six decades for the mystery to finally be solved.</p><p>The baby grew up to be 64-year-old Phoenix, Ariz. resident Steve Dennis, and he admits that even he didn’t believe his own story when he first heard it, according to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Lancaster Eagle-Gazette</a>. His adoptive parents, Stanley and Vivian Dennis, have told him he was adopted since he was just&nbsp;three years old, but it wasn’t until he was 15 or 16 that he first heard the story about being discovered in a phone booth.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-186284 alt="Newspaper Headline About Baby In Phone Booth" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/newspaper-baby-phone-booth.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-186284 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Meagan Flynn/The Washington Post</span><span class=caption-body>The front page of the Lancaster Eagle-Gazette on Jan. 16, 1954, after the baby was found.</span></p><p>When he was around 18 or 19, Steve Dennis visited the restaurant on U.S. Route 22 outside of Lancaster, Ohio where he was found, but did not find anything of importance. Dennis then pushed the mystery out of his mind for decades until his teenage daughters began asking questions about his history.</p><p>According to the Lancaster Eagle-Gazette, they got him an Ancestry.com DNA testing kit that helped him find one of his genetic relatives. Dennis connected with his first cousin, who was also using Ancestry.com and began to get answers to questions that he had been asking his whole life.</p><p>“He said, ‘I think I know who your mother is. We’ve heard throughout our lives that there’s a baby that we’re related to that was left in a telephone booth,'” Dennis told the&nbsp;Lancaster Eagle-Gazette. “It was like this hidden secret.”</p><p>His cousin then connected Dennis to his half-sister, who echoed her cousin’s statement, saying that she too had heard about her mother’s “deep dark secret” but wasn’t sure if it was true or not. She got a DNA test as well and it confirmed that they were indeed half-siblings.</p><p>Dennis’ sister then contacted their mother, who is now 85 years old, and she has slowly started remembering more and more details about her first-born child.</p><p>Dennis was told that his mother was 18 when she had him. At the time, she was told by his father that if she left the baby, he would marry her. While the couple was traveling from Ohio to Kentucky, where Dennis was born, his father took the baby, left him in the phone booth and disappeared for good.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-186301 alt="Steve Dennis With Baby Photos" width=600 height=776 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/steve-dennis-with-baby-photos.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-186301 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Cheryl Evans/The Republic</span><span class=caption-body>Steve Dennis reviewing photos and newspaper headlines about his story.</span></p><p>Dennis’ birth mom went on to marry another man and had two daughters. Dennis also had a full life despite his rocky beginning. He was in the Peace Corps and traveled the world, has been married to his wife Maria, with whom he shares two daughters, for 22 years, and recently retired after making a career as a chiropractor.</p><p>At the end of August, Dennis plans to travel to Maryland to connect with his birth mother for the first time in 64 years. He hopes to learn some information about his early life and possibly his birth date but said that he isn’t going to put too much pressure on the meeting.</p><p>“I’m not going to make a real big deal about this,” Steve Dennis told the Lancaster Eagle-Gazette about reuniting with his mother. “I’ll just take whatever she gives me and leave it at that. I mean you can’t hassle an 85-year-old woman … So whatever she feels comfortable saying to me, I’ll take. It’s more than I had before.”</p><p>It seems like the heartbreaking story of an abandoned baby might just get a happy ending after all.</p><p>After this look at Steve Dennis, discover the <a href=#>mystery of Nicholas Barclay</a> and his imposter, Frederic Bourdin. After that, read up on <a href=#>Bobby Dunbar</a>, the boy who disappeared and came back as a new child.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony0wMSvnGaclaO7qr%2BMm5ibsV2ltbC6xGaZqKeknQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./steven-tyler-4.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Steven Tyler Age, Net Worth, Wife, Family, Children and Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./snake-wine.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Southeast Asia's Creepiest Alternative Medicine</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./firefly-lane-timeline-what-years-do-the-show-take-place-in.html>'Firefly Lane' Timeline - What Years Do the Show Take Place In?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./funny-news-2018.html>14 Hilariously Funny News Stories You Missed In 2018</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./nazi-rise-to-power.html>36 Chilling Photos That Explain The Nazis' Rise To Power</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./5-horrifying-facts-regarding-lori-ann-slesinskis-murder.html>5 Horrifying Facts Regarding Lori Ann Slesinskis Murder</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ali-ahn-2.html>Ali Ahn Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaVibe.
