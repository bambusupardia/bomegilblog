She is the daughter of Joann Cook and Thomas H. Cook.&nbsp;His father is Daniel Gillies, a Canadian actor, and director best known for his part in The Vampire Diaries.&nbsp;On August 8, 2004, they married. They have two children together.</p><p>Their daughter Charlotte Easton Gillies was born in September 2013, and their son Theodore Vigo Sullivan Gillies was born in April 2015.&nbsp;In the photo below, he is with his father and mother. His father shared this adorable photo of them on Instagram.&nbsp;He’s seen with his mother and sister. His mother posted the picture on Instagram.&nbsp;She captioned it as&nbsp;‘And the Oscar goes….’</p><h2>The Story Behind His Name</h2><p>He was born on April 4, 2015, and it took four days to settle on a name for the baby.&nbsp;His parents sought a name that was both distinctive and significant.&nbsp;As it was a major choice for them, the actor Daniel one said in the interview that he goes by nicknames like “Sweetheart,” “Rasin,” and even “Calcified alien” in the meantime.&nbsp;However, before his birth, his parents narrowed it down to two names.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Theodore-Vigo-Sullivan-Gillies-1.jpg><p>The pair still has 700 names on their list, and they also made a kind of Venn Diagram to see which names overlapped.&nbsp;Then they chose their top selections from the list.&nbsp;When he was born, the parents couldn’t decide whether to name him Theodore or Vigo.&nbsp;After considerable deliberation, they chose to incorporate both names with the assistance of a numerologist.&nbsp;In the end, he received both names, and his mother liked Sullivan’s name, so they included it in his name as well.&nbsp;Because he was born on the fourth day of the fourth month, his father chose to give him four names.&nbsp;As a result, they chose the name Theodore Vigo Sullivan Gillies for their newborn boy.</p><h2>Divorce</h2><p>The pair formally terminated their engagement in June 2019.&nbsp;Their followers were devastated when this news emerged on social media.&nbsp;Through the Instagram post, the pair announced the breakup of their 15-year marriage.&nbsp;They stated in the open letter that it was a difficult choice for them to split as a couple, that they had many wonderful moments together, and that they begged their supporters not to spread hate about this for the sake of their children.</p><p>When they announced their divorce, Daniel was shooting in New Zealand, and both of them wanted to talk to their children about it, but one at a time.&nbsp;Rachael said in an interview that as long as her children are safe, she will be safe as well.&nbsp;Nobody warns you how difficult adulting will be, and I am learning.&nbsp;The couple mutually agreed to divorce. However, the cause for their divorce is still unclear.&nbsp;The couple is still on excellent terms, and they are each other’s best friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Theodore-Vigo-Sullivan-Gillies-2.jpg><h2><strong>Theodore Vigo Sullivan Gillies </strong>Net Worth 2023</h2><p>His mother<strong>, Rachael Leigh Cook, is believed to have a net worth of $5 million.</strong>&nbsp;Her yearly salary has yet to be disclosed in the media.&nbsp;Her main source of income is her work as an actor and producer.
