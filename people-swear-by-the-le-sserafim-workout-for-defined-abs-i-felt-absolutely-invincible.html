The Kpop group explained it perfectly in a TikTok video: “It was a workout we did when we were preparing for the group. It was like our training workout. It was very strenuous. It was 100 jumping jacks as a warm-up, and then 100 burpees, and then three sets of four different plank exercises with 25 reps and stuff. It was very intense. And we did that like, for two hours, twice a day. But, it helped us build stamina for our choreo.”</p><p>The full list of exercises in this routine includes:</p><ul><li>100 jumping jacks</li><li>100 burpees</li><li>2 sets of 10 jump squats</li><li>plank crawls (for the duration of the song)</li><li>2 sets of 10 plank up and downs</li><li>2 sets of 10 plank twists</li><li>3 sets of 25 crunches</li></ul><p>This routine may not be for the faint of heart, but it’s chock-full of benefits. “The Le Sserafim workout is effective for weight loss, strength, and stamina due to its comprehensive structure. The cardio block … boosts heart rate and burns calories, aiding in fat loss,” explains <strong>Tyler Read, BSc, CPT</strong>, the founder of PTPioneer.com and a personal trainer who’s been involved in health and fitness for the past 15 years. “[In addition,] the strength training segment … builds muscle mass, which improves metabolism and overall strength. The combination of these elements leads to improved stamina and cardiovascular health, making it a well-rounded fitness routine.”</p><p class=c-article__related-link><span class=c-article__related-link-inner>RELATED: 9 Lazy Ways to Lose Weight All Month Long</span></p><h2>People claim the Le Sserafim workout is an effective way to lose weight and achieve a flat tummy.</h2><p>People on TikTok are doing Le Sserafim’s workout and documenting their journeys along the way. TikToker Hanna Kim revealed in a video, “I tried Le Sserafim’s workout routine for a week, and as Huh Yun-jin said, ‘You might actually pass out.’ This was no joke. Hardcore workouts and training routines are nothing new in the Kpop industry, but this one in particular took the world by storm for its notable intensity.”</p><p>Kim explained she cruised through the first part of the routine—100 “star jumps,” or jumping jacks”—and felt “really good.” Next, the 100 burpees brought out the intensity of the workout.
