The unidentified man was filmed by an American tourist carving “Ivan + Hayley 23/6/23” onto the wall of the 2,000-year-old structure with a set of keys.</p><p>“I consider it very serious, unworthy, and a sign of great incivility that a tourist defaces one of the most famous places in the world, the Colosseum, to engrave the name of his fiancée,” the Italian culture minister, Gennaro Sangiuliano, <a href=# rel=noopener>said on Twitter</a> alongside a video the man. “I hope that whoever did this will be identified and sanctioned according to our laws.”</p><p>Those sanctions would be severe. The tourist could face a fine of at least $15,000 and a prison term of up to five years.</p><p>The man — presumably named Ivan — was caught on film by American tourist Ryan Lutz. According to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Associated Press</a>, Lutz noticed the man “blatantly carving his name” into the Colosseum wall after Lutz finished a tour of the site. In shock, he took out his phone and started filming.</p><p>“And as you see in the video, I kind of approach him and ask him, dumbfounded at this point, ‘Are you serious? Are you really serious?'” Lutz said. “And all he could do is like smile at me.”</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Times</a>, the wall that the man defaced is not part of the original 2,000-year-old structure, but a section built during a mid-19th century restoration. For Italian officials, that doesn’t change much.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-442822 alt="Colosseum In Rome" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/colosseum-in-rome.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-442822 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Jaroslav Petrek, @petrekfoto/Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The Colosseum is one of the most well-known historic sites in Rome.</span></p><p>“Mid-19th century or original, that doesn’t change the fact that it’s vandalism,” Alfonsina Russo, the director of the Colosseum, told The New York Times.</p><p>It’s not the first time in recent years that someone has vandalized the Colosseum, which was completed in 80 C.E. and used as a grand amphitheater that could seat between 50,000 and 80,000 people.</p><p>The Associated Press reports that in 2014, a Russian tourist was fined €20,000 and given a four-year suspended jail sentence for carving a large “K” into the monument. <a href=# rel=noopener>The Guardian</a> reports that a man from Ireland and a German teen were also disciplined for defacing the Colosseum in 2020.</p><p>Italy has introduced harsh laws for transgressions like these in recent years, but they haven’t entirely stemmed the tide of bad tourist behavior. Last year, a tourist pushed an electric scooter down Rome’s 18th-century Spanish Steps, causing €25,000 of damage, and two other tourists were reprimanded for riding motorized surfboards in Venice’s Grand Canal.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-442834 alt="Tourists On Spanish Steps" width=744 height=542 data-sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/tourists-on-spanish-steps.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-442834 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Polizia Roma Capitale</span><span class=caption-body>Police video of the tourists using scooters on Rome’s historic Spanish Steps.</span></p><p>This sort of behavior is, however, condemned by most other tourists.</p><p>“We have to preserve what we have,” Diego Cruz, an American student in Rome, told the Associated Press. “There is a rich history here. It helps us learn from the past.”</p><p>Güldamla Ozsema, a computer engineer visiting from Turkey, seconded Cruz, adding that Turkey has also struggled with destructive tourists. “I really get angry with them, with this behavior,” he said.</p><p>Indeed, as the search continues for “Ivan,” Italian officials like Tourism Minister Daniela Santanche have stressed that visitors to Rome and elsewhere in Italy need to respect their surroundings.</p><p>“We cannot allow those who visit our nation to feel free to behave in this way,” she said.</p><p>After reading about the tourist who was filmed defacing the Colosseum, see how an <a href=#>American tourist smashed two statues at the Vatican</a> after being denied an audience with the Pope.
